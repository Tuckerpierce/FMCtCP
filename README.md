*From MakeCode to Circuit Python*, an open text by students of Bates College and amazing people anywhere.

This work began as a collection of chapters brought together by students in the winter '18 offering of *DCS 102: Design of Computational Systems* at Bates College. Its future history is, as of yet, unwritten.

Our work is made publicly available under an MIT license. We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests, and hope this work is valuable to other learners using MakeCode, Circuit Python, and the Adafruit Circuit Python Express. (It might also be useful to other users of MakeCode and Python, but we make no guarantees.)
