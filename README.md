# FMCtCP

*From MakeCode to Circuit Python*, an open text by students of Bates College and amazing people anywhere.

This work began as a collection of chapters brought together by students in the winter '18 offering of *DCS 102: Design of Computational Systems* at Bates College. Its future history is, as of yet, unwritten.

Our work is made publicly available under an MIT license. We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests. We hope this work is valuable to other learners using MakeCode, Circuit Python, and the Adafruit Circuit Python Express. (It might also be useful to other users of MakeCode and Python, but we make no guarantees.)

# Attribution

It is the practice of this project to maintain a CONTRIBUTORS file, and acknowledge contributions in this way. Attribution is not made on a chapter-by-chapter or contribution-by-contribution basis, and pull requests that violate this practice will be rejected until they are revised.

Good practice for this project is to add yourself to the CONTRIBUTORS file as part of your pull request, alphabetically. 

# Copyright and Contributor License Agreement

We do not have a contributor license agreement. However, by making a pull request to the FMCtCP repository, we must tacitly assume that you are agreeing to the MIT License attached to this work, which provides broad permissions to the maintainer (jadudm) of this repository.
